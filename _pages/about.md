Welcome! My name is William and I'm a Finance PhD student at UC Berkeley Haas. My current research interests lie broadly in Behavioural Finance/Economics, Household Finance, Financial Technology, and Corporate Finance. 

Previously, I've worked with Dr. Bradley Ruffle doing Behavioural and Experimental economics research in the McMaster Decision Science Laboratory. I received my B.A.Sc in Arts & Science and Computer Science from McMaster University.
