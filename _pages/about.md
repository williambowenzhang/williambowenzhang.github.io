Welcome! I'm currently a Finance PhD student at UC Berkeley Haas. My present research interests lie broadly in Behavioural Finance/Economics, Household Finance, Financial Technology, and Corporate Finance. 

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Bradley Ruffle](https://sites.google.com/site/bradleyruffle/) on Behavioural and Experimental Economics research in the McMaster Decision Science Laboratory. I received my B.Arts.Sc. in [Arts & Science and Computer Science](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca) from McMaster University.
